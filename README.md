### Cool Assignment Template: "A Cool Template for Assignments":tm:

- Cool Assignment Template is a LaTeX template that allows you to easily and quickly create 
great looking assignments. 
- User friendly -- just copy and paste your work into the template and let your favorite LaTeX compiler do the
rest!
- Stupid simple directions included within the .tex file! Just copy and paste!
- Drop raw code in and it will render in the index!
- Images render with ease!

### But why?
Let's face it -- you suck at typesetting. We were sick of reading your 
terribly formatted mess that you've written in word, so we've done the hard work for you (well, the typesetting
anyway). This makes everyone's lives much easier and will probably put your marker in a better mood. You want
your marker to be in a good mood -- unless you don't want a good grade. 

### Getting Started

We have two suggested methods: 
- Use overleaf.com
- Download and install pdflatex and build via command line
